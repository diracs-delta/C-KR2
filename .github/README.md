# Solutions to The C Programming Language, 2nd ed.

These are my personal solutions to The C Programming Language, 2nd ed. They
each include a `main()` method that performs several tests demonstrating the
efficacy of each function requested in the corresponding exercise. I have taken
the liberty of adding comments to sections of code I consider somewhat
incomprehensible or clever. I have also tested the limiting cases of each
function, and they should all hold regardless of the maximum size of the array,
defined as `ARRAY_MAX`.
